# Chrome Extension

## To-do

- [ ] GitHub Workflows
  - [ ] Upon pushing to `chrome-extension`, zip and put it into the root directory as `calendarize-webreg-chrome.zip`
  - [ ] Upon pushing to `calendarize.js`, minify it and copy it to `chrome-extension`
- [x] Test extension in development (WebReg access / local WebReg page html file needed)
- [ ] (Pending!) Publish extension to Chrome Web Store
- [ ] (Good for now, but revisit right before merge) Proofread & update README.md
- [x] Extra: Establish basic linting / formatting environment w/ ESLint & Prettier
